# Test 3
Tests: Serving local, static files.

## Expected
The app should now show a gray background with the word "Hello".

## On Failure
Try re-installing the app. Maybe the assets added in this step were not
properly synchronized.

If this fails, the problem likely lies with the serving of local, static files.
