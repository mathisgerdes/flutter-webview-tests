# Test 6
Tests: javascript channels.

## Expected
The app should now show a button saying "show snackbar". If pressed,
a snackbar reading "hello" should appear.

## On Failure
Try re-installing the app. Maybe the assets added in this step were not
properly synchronized.

Inspect the logs for any javascript errors thrown.
